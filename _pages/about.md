Located in the Department of Computer Science at Georgetown University, the Theory & Algorithms Group consists of seven faculty members, along with their PhD students and postdocs, focused on core topics in both theoretical computer science and algorithms, with a particular emphasis on problems with practical application.

We are always looking for new graduate students and postdocs who are interested in joining our large and highly collaborative group. We offer an environment in which you can interact with multiple faculty members and be exposed to many cutting edge topics. Feel free to contact any of our professor's for collaborative opportunities.
