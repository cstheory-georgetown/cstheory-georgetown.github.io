Located in the Department of Computer Science at Georgetown University, the Theory & Algorithms Group consists of nine faculty members, along with PhD students and postdocs, focused on core topics in both theoretical computer science and algorithms, with a particular emphasis on problems with practical applications.

We are always looking for new graduate students and postdocs who are interested in joining our large and highly collaborative group. We offer an environment in which you can interact with multiple faculty members and be exposed to many cutting edge topics. Feel free to contact any of our professors for collaborative opportunities.
