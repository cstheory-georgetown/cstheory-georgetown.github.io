### Abstract

In his breakthrough work(STOC 2017), Ta-shma gave a binary
code construction which nearly matches Gilbert-Varshamov bound in
terms of rate-distance tradeoff. I will describe our recent work on
list decoding this code upto the popular Johnson bound radius. Our
algorithm is semi-definite programming hierarchy based and at the core
of our analysis is an expander mixing lemma based recursive argument.
This is a joint work with Silas Richelson.
