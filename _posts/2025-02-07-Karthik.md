### Abstract
In this talk we will look at the oblivious counter parts of some popular complexity classes. 
We will see the resolution of two very interesting open problems:
1) A fixed polynomial circuit lower bound for a uniform class contained in P/poly
2) A uniform hierarchy theorem of a semantic class that contains BPP.
   
Our results follow via the powerful range avoidance framework, and the notion of  "uniformly-sparse extensions" , our main technical contribution, that might be of independent interest.
