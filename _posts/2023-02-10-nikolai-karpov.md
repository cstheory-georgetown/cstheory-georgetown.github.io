### Abstract
We consider the following problem: given a set of n distributions, find the top-m ones with the largest means. This problem is also called top-m arm identifications in the literature of reinforcement learning, and has numerous applications. We study the problem in the collaborative learning model where we have multiple agents who can draw samples from n distributions in parallel. In this talk, we discuss tradeoffs between the running time of learning process and the number of rounds of interaction between agents.
