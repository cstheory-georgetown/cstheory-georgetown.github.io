### Abstract
In this talk we will discuss the recent algorithmic progress made on the Massively Parallel Computations (MPC) model. The MPC model provides a clean theoretical abstraction of modern parallel computation frameworks such as MapReduce, Hadoop, Spark, etc., which have been extremely successful in processing large-scale data-sets.

Our main focus in the talk will be on the maximal matching problem. We give an outline of the analysis of an extremely simple algorithm, improving exponentially over previous maximal matching results. The analysis is based on a novel method of proving concentration bounds for algorithms satisfying a certain "locality" property, which we believe may find applications beyond the MPC model. We will also survey some other recent results in the area. Particularly, we will overview an algorithm for edit distance and longest common subsequence with almost tight  bounds.
