### Abstract

The study of quantum many-body physics is challenging due to the exponential growing nature of high dimensional Hilbert space. In this talk, I will present recent advancements for simulating quantum many-body physics with neural networks utilizing efficient representation and optimization techniques. Applications to condensed matter physics, high energy physics and quantum information science will be discussed.
